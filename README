See the file COPYING for license details.

The currently supported platforms are Linux, Solaris, IRIX, OpenBSD, and
FreeBSD. If you want support for other platforms, take a look at 
output_*.c for an idea of what you need to do.

This software is completely useless to 99.99 percent of users
out there. It is mostly of use to those interested in audio
coding research and evaluating codecs. It could theoretically
be used as a portion of a DVD playback system for unix systems. 

HOW TO COMPILE

Building a52dec should be easy. Here's how:

./configure && make all

USAGE

To find A-52 streams on the internet, use www.google.com and
search for "vob trailer". A vob is a "Video Object" which is
just an MPEG-2 stream. The site www.hollywood.com has a
few good MPEG-2s with A-52 audio. The program tools/extract_a52
will take an MPEG-2 stream and spit out A-52 audio to stdout if
it exists. You can easily pipe this data to the a52 player like
this:

  ./tools/extract_a52 foo.vob | ./a52dec/

You can also get A-52 streams on a DVD. Check out
http://www.linuxvideo.org for details.

DEBUG OUTPUT

You can get a whole pile of debug info by setting the environment
variable A52_DEBUG=1. Be sure to pipe stderr to a file or you probably
won't get realtime playback. You can pipe stderr to a file like so:

  ./a52dec foo.a52 2> debug.out
