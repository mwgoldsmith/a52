* implement A/52a downmix extensions

* get rid of globals in bitstream parsing
* get rid of statics in imdct.c
* avoid overflows, including reading the a52 stream !!!
* make dither code faster (generate dither table in advance ?)
* redo all bit allocation if previous frame had zero_snr_offsets
* make dynrng work in dual-channel streams

* finish a52_internal.h cleanup
	* use sensible data types
	* move some arrays into bit fields
* imdct.c
	* maybe use a single w[] array with only positive values
	* use split-radix algorithm
* cplfleak/cplsleak: move 2304-x in bit_allocate.c ?

* see if we can get rid of cplcoe in the phsflginu test

* update bitstream code


from aaron:

- Detect hrtime on solaris and enable it via config.h
- Add multilevel debug output
- change the divides/moduluos in coeff_get_mantissa to table
  lookups. Need to look at stats first though.
- rewrite imdct to use split 2/4 radix fft
- investigate strangeness in 256 point imdct (weird transients?)
